I found a promising data-set.

I think this will be an ideal data-set for our project for the following reasons:
1) Easier to cleanse this data than other data formats (i.e.: interactive maps filled with data, drawings, broad statistics in article form).
2) Data is pre-organized according to job title, fitting for our theme.
3) Data is from a reliable source (US Bureau of Labor Statistics).
